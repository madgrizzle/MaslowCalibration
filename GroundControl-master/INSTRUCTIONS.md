Ground Control is the program which runs on your computer and lets you control your machine. It provides controls to move the machine around, gives you a digital position readout, and lets you open and run Gcode files.

Ground Control is free and is updated every other week with new features.

Ground Control runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.

### Please note:

The first time you open Ground Control you will need to tell it how to connect to your machine. Click **Actions** in the top left corner of the screen, click the **Ports** drop down to select the same port you chose when uploading the firmware, then press **Connect**. Your choice will be remembered so you do not need to do this step again.
